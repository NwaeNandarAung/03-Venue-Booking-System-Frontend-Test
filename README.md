## Detailed Description
For this test, a static webpage that displays all the events for the room for today and this week is created. As the requirement, the roomId is accepted as the parameter and the content can be dynamic based on the roomId. The frontend design is created to be as similar as the given UI design. However, because of not using other javascript framework or css framework, there will be some responsive problem in the small screen size. Since responsive issue is not described in the requirement, it has been ignored. Since it is the static webpage and only javascript and css is allowed to use, no other backend programming language, framework and libraries are used except javascript and jquery. Therefore, the booking events for this week have been extracted just by filtering day by day of the week. Because of time limitation, only the booking events for today and this week are displayed.
